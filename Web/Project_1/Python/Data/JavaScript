<strong><u>JavaScript</u></strong></a> often abbreviated as <span id="second" class="js">JS</span>, is a high-level, interpreted programming
language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the three core technologies of
World Wide Web content engineering. It is used to make dynamic webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by
means of a built-in <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine. Each of the many <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engines represent a different implementation of <span class="js">JavaScript</span>, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with
some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
